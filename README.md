Reporting a group of Sybil attacker addresses

To report a group of Sybil attacker addresses, create an issue on this repo and use the "Sybil Attacker Report" template.

Rules:

    Reports will be reviewed on a first-come, first serve basis.
    Reports must contain at least 10 address still in /src/data/eligibleAddresses.txt once repo is live
    The methodology must be well explained and easy to understand. Self-reports can provide a list of signatures of "PLAY_SYBIL_REPORT" to prove ownership of all reported addresses.
    Methodology that has a non-negligible chance of eliminating legitimate users will not be considered
